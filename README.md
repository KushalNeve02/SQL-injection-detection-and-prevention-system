# SQL-injection-detection-and-prevention-system
📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting and preventing SQL Injection attacks, one of the most common and critical web security vulnerabilities. The system validates and sanitizes user inputs to protect backend databases from malicious queries.

🚀 Features

Detects malicious SQL injection patterns

Prevents unauthorized database access

Input validation and sanitization

Secure query handling

Demonstrates core web security principles

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend / Logic: Python

Database: MySQL

Security Concepts: Input validation, query sanitization

Tools: VS Code

⚙️ How It Works

User input is captured from the application interface

Input is analyzed for SQL injection patterns

Malicious queries are blocked or sanitized

Only safe queries are executed on the database

🎯 Use Case

Educational demonstration of SQL Injection attacks

Learning secure coding practices

Cybersecurity and web security projects

Hackathons and academic submissions


Support for more attack patterns

Web-based dashboard for monitoring attacks
